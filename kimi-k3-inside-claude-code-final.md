I just spent a few days running [Moonshot AI's Kimi K3](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k3) inside Claude Code.

K3 is Moonshot's new 2.8-trillion-parameter model, with native vision and a one-million-token context window. Moonshot calls it the first open model at this scale and says the weights will be released by July 27. Its own launch post is also unusually candid: it says K3 still trails Fable 5 and GPT-5.6 Sol overall, and that its user experience is not yet at the same level.

That sounded like a much more interesting model to test than one claiming to have solved everything.

There was another reason for doing it now. While I was writing this, Alibaba [announced Qwen 3.8](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2078759124914098291), another very large model headed for an open-weight release. Then Thinking Machines Lab released [Inkling](https://thinkingmachines.ai/news/introducing-inkling/), a 975-billion-parameter US model with 41 billion active parameters and full weights available. Kimi is not a one-off anymore. There is now a queue.

## Same Claude Code, different model

I have burned millions of tokens through Claude Code by now. My config works, the tools are where I expect them to be, and I know the odd little rhythms of the harness. I did not want to learn a new coding agent just to test a model.

So I kept Claude Code and changed the part behind it.

Using [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), I routed the requests to Kimi K3. That was the experiment: same terminal, same project, same habits, different model.

{{< img src="kimi-in-claude.png" alt="Claude Code configured to use Moonshot AI's Kimi K3 through OpenRouter." width="80%" >}}

## First impression: slow

It felt slow. Very slow, at first.

Which is odd, because the measured numbers say otherwise. [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/comparisons/kimi-k3-vs-claude-opus-4-8) reports about 62 output tokens per second for Kimi K3 and 57 for Claude Opus 4.8. It also measures a much shorter time to first token for K3.

That was not what the terminal felt like.

Maybe the difference was time spent reasoning before useful text appeared. Maybe it was the cadence of the stream. Maybe I have simply used Claude Code for long enough that anything with a different rhythm feels wrong. Raw tok/s clearly does not capture the whole interaction.

Then, somewhere during the first hour, I stopped noticing.

Not because K3 suddenly became faster. I had just started working. It handled files, edits and tool calls well enough that I forgot where the traffic was going. For a model running inside somebody else's harness, that is a fairly strong result.

## A quick frontend test

K3 has been getting attention for frontend work, so I wanted something visual rather than another coding benchmark.

I reused the prompt and assets from [this Lafys build](https://lafys.com/posts/ai-smart-solution-full-website-1783698696773). I assume the reference was made with Fable 5, although I cannot verify that. I left the instructions and asset pack alone and changed the model.

Here is the result.

{{< img src="section-1-productivity.jpeg" alt="Reference design on the left and Kimi K3 reconstruction of the Productivity section on the right." width="100%" >}}

{{< img src="section-2-flexibility.jpeg" alt="Reference design on the left and Kimi K3 reconstruction of the Flexibility section on the right." width="100%" >}}

{{< img src="section-3-unify-teams.jpeg" alt="Reference design on the left and Kimi K3 reconstruction of the Unify Teams section on the right." width="100%" >}}

{{< img src="section-4-team-created.png" alt="Reference design on the left and Kimi K3 reconstruction of the Team Created section on the right." width="100%" >}}

Judge it yourself. I think it is close.

Also, this is one run, with very specific instructions and the original assets. Give the model a vaguer brief and the result may fall apart. A screenshot comparison says almost nothing about how it behaves after three hours in a messy codebase, whether it notices a bad premise, or whether it recovers cleanly after a tool error.

Still, the gap in these four frames is not what I would have expected from an open model a year ago.

## The bill

The OpenRouter export for this run contains 115 requests, 13.64 million prompt tokens and 82,307 output tokens. Of the prompt tokens, 12.95 million were cache hits. Total cost: $7.18.

Applying Anthropic's published list prices to that exact traffic mix gives about $11.96 for Claude Opus 4.8 and $23.92 for Claude Fable 5. In this run, then, Kimi came out roughly 40% cheaper than Opus and 70% cheaper than Fable.

The arithmetic uses 684,943 uncached prompt tokens at the normal input rate, 12.95 million cached tokens at the cache-hit rate, and 82,307 output tokens at the output rate. It is a billing comparison, not a claim that the models would take the same route through the task. A better model may need fewer turns. A worse one may save money per token and waste it all by wandering.

That distinction matters with K3. It currently launches at max reasoning effort, and cheap tokens are less impressive if the model uses many more of them. The right unit is eventually cost per finished task. I do not have enough repeated runs to make that comparison yet.

## Is it an Opus replacement?

No. Not for me.

Opus still feels more dependable when the work gets difficult. It is better at knowing when to stop, better at handling ambiguity, and less likely to make an energetic decision I did not ask for. Moonshot itself lists excessive proactiveness and harness sensitivity among K3's limitations, which matches parts of my experience.

I would not call K3 a Fable 5-class model either.

But below Fable and Opus the air gets thin very quickly. K3 is close enough that many users will not care about the remaining difference, or will care less than they care about the bill. And if the model sits behind the same interface, the switching cost can be one config change.

That is the part I keep coming back to. I did not move from Claude Code to a Chinese coding product. I kept Claude Code and swapped the engine.

{{< readnext slug="when-ai-labs-become-defense-contractors" >}}

## So where do we go from here?

The takes over the past few days have gone in every direction.

Kimi K3 is the end of the American model moat. Kimi K3 is benchmark theatre. Open weights make closed models obsolete. Open weights are irrelevant if running the thing costs a small data centre. China is deliberately commoditising the layer on which a large part of the US market is now betting. Or there is no master plan and Chinese labs are releasing good models because good models bring developers, usage and prestige.

A less dramatic list from my notes looks like this:

- $/token is a bad measure when models use very different numbers of tokens.
- Public benchmarks are easier to optimise for and worse at separating the top models.
- Open weights put a ceiling on API prices even if most users never self-host.
- The model is becoming replaceable; the harness, data and workflow may not be.
- Value moves up into applications and down into chips, power and inference infrastructure.
- Open weights help with control and privacy, but "open" does not mean cheap to run.
- Export controls can slow Chinese labs and, at the same time, give them a reason to build around the US stack.
- The biggest threat is not necessarily that Kimi becomes number one. It is that nobody stays number one for long.

The last point is the one that matters.

[Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/open-closed-eci-gap) estimates that the best open-weight models trail the closed frontier by only a few months. Exact gaps move with the benchmark, and public evaluations should be read with care, but the direction is hard to miss. The lag is short enough that buyers can wait, switch or split workloads across providers.

Personally, I think this can be distilled, yes, I know, into a threat and an opportunity.

## The threat

The threat is not that Kimi K3 is better than every American model. It is not.

The threat is that it may be good enough to make the premium harder to defend.

The large US labs are valued on more than technical competence. The financial case assumes that frontier intelligence stays scarce, that the lead lasts, and that customers keep paying high margins for access. A model can damage that story without taking first place. It only needs to sit close enough to the frontier, at a lower price, and be easy to slot into existing software.

That is a bad combination for pricing power.

Most enterprise software is sticky because switching is awful. Databases, operating systems and core banking platforms accumulate years of dependencies. A language model behind an API is different. The model may be deeply important while still being surprisingly easy to replace. My Claude Code test is the small version of that: the workflow stayed put and the supplier changed.

Closed labs still have ways to earn the premium. Reliability matters. Tool use matters. Enterprise controls matter. Being six months ahead can be worth a lot when the task is valuable enough. But they may have to prove that advantage on each workload instead of charging for the brand of "frontier" in general.

The timing is awkward because the infrastructure bill is enormous. I already wrote about this in [AI Capex Arms Race: Who Blinks First?](https://philippdubach.com/posts/ai-capex-arms-race-who-blinks-first/). The issue there was not whether AI creates value. It plainly does. The issue was how much revenue has to arrive, and how quickly, to support the data centres, GPUs, debt and depreciation already being committed.

If model capability commoditises faster than revenue grows, the damage does not stop at the labs. It runs through hyperscalers, chipmakers, data-centre developers, utilities and the lenders financing the build-out. A cheaper Kimi is good for users and potentially bad for whoever underwrote scarcity.

Then there is the policy problem.

The US controls much of the closed-model frontier and much of the hardware underneath it. That is leverage, but only while the rest of the world remains dependent on the same stack. Restricting chips and APIs may preserve the lead. It can also make a parallel stack more valuable.

I wrote about the other side of this in [Krugman, Fable 5, and Europe in Decline?](https://philippdubach.com/posts/krugman-fable5-europe-decline/). A closed model can be cut off by its provider or by the provider's government. Once open weights have spread, they cannot be switched off in the same way. The closed system gives its maker more control. The open one gives everybody downstream more room to leave.

That does not make open models independent of US technology. They still need accelerators, networking, software and power. K3 is a good example: Moonshot recommends a supernode with 64 or more accelerators. Open weights remove one chokepoint, not the whole chain.

There is another, more mundane risk: we may be overrating the model.

Every launch now comes with a dense page of benchmark wins. Some are real. Some use different harnesses, different budgets or model-specific tuning. Some benchmarks are simply saturated. A model that looks brilliant in a leaderboard can still be unpleasant over a long session.

My own frontend test is useful because it is visible, but it is also easy to overread. It tells you K3 can follow a detailed design prompt with supplied assets. It does not tell you whether it can maintain a production system, debug an intermittent failure or resist digging a deeper hole after the first wrong assumption.

The dangerous purchase is the one made from the screenshot.

## The opportunity

The opportunity starts with cheaper intelligence, but it does not end there.

At lower prices, more tasks become worth attempting. Agents can take more passes, read more context and handle work that is useful but not important enough to justify Fable pricing. Lower unit costs may not shrink the market at all. They may just turn occasional model calls into something that sits in the workflow all day.

My test is a trivial example. K3 did not need to beat Fable 5. It needed to be good enough that I was happy to let it retry.

The more interesting opportunity is separation. The interface, agent and model do not have to come from the same company.

A routine refactor can go to a cheaper model. A difficult architecture decision can go to Opus. Sensitive material can stay on a private deployment. Frontend work can go to whichever model happens to be best at it that month. The durable product may be the router, context layer and validation loop rather than any single model.

This is also where open weights matter beyond price. They let an organisation fine-tune, quantise and deploy a model under its own controls. That does not automatically make the result secure or compliant, but it changes who gets to answer the hard questions about data location, retention, access and continuity.

### Put the model in the basement

I have been thinking about this for a while.

In [How DORA Made Sovereignty a Bank Problem](https://philippdubach.com/posts/dora-critical-cloud-providers-sovereignty/) I argued that data sovereignty has moved out of the policy brochure and into operations. Banks now have to think about concentration, exit plans, audit rights and what happens when a critical foreign provider changes the rules.

AI will get the same treatment.

The consumer version is on-device AI, which I wrote about in [On-Device AI Models Will Be the New Reason to Upgrade Your Phone](https://philippdubach.com/posts/on-device-ai-models-will-be-the-new-reason-to-upgrade-your-phone/). Move the model from a remote service onto hardware the user controls. At enterprise scale the hardware is less photogenic. It is a rack of GPUs in a Swiss data centre. Same idea.

Until recently that came with a large capability penalty. The newer releases make the calculation less silly. Kimi K3 is huge and its weights are due shortly. Alibaba is pushing the Qwen family in the same direction. [Inkling](https://thinkingmachines.ai/news/introducing-inkling/) matters because it adds a serious US-trained model with full weights available, one-million-token context and a clear focus on customisation. Thinking Machines is explicit that it is not the best model overall. That is fine. The useful part is having more than one credible source of open models.

So I did a back-of-the-napkin business case.

The sketch assumes a Swiss provider running one 64-GPU cluster in Zurich and selling dedicated or managed K3-class inference to banks, pharmaceutical companies, government bodies and other customers that care about Swiss data residency.

{{< img src="swiss-sovereign-ai-business-case.png" alt="Back-of-the-napkin business case for a Swiss sovereign AI provider, with infrastructure assumptions, capex, monthly operating costs, customer mix, five-year projections and sensitivity cases." width="80%" >}}

The model uses roughly $7 million of initial capex, $370,000 of monthly operating cost, 70% utilisation and subscriptions between CHF 15,000 and CHF 50,000 per month. With those assumptions, one cluster reaches about CHF 7.4 million of annual revenue, CHF 3 million of EBITDA and a three-year payback.

Do not take the cells too seriously. Throughput, quantisation, GPU pricing, utilisation, power and support costs could all move the answer a long way. The sheet is an illustration, not an investment recommendation.

What interested me is that the idea can now be put into a spreadsheet without the first line already being absurd.

The product would not really be tokens. It would be control: Swiss residency, a defined security perimeter, no training on customer data, audit access, contractual continuity and an exit route if the operator fails. Most companies will not literally put the model in the basement. They may pay somebody local to give them the functional equivalent.

There are reasons this may not work. A 2.8-trillion-parameter model is expensive to serve. One cluster is its own concentration risk. Hardware ages quickly. If utilisation drops, the economics get ugly. If a much smaller model performs nearly as well next year, the expensive rack becomes a monument to last year's benchmark.

Even so, I think this market will exist. Not for every prompt and not for every company. For sensitive workloads, the last few points of benchmark performance may be worth less than knowing where the model runs and who can turn it off.

{{< readnext slug="dora-critical-cloud-providers-sovereignty" >}}

## Close enough changes the market

I do not think Kimi K3 kills Anthropic. I do not think one frontend reconstruction proves parity. And I would still choose Opus for the hardest coding work today.

But K3 was good enough that I forgot I was using it. It cost materially less. It ran inside the harness I already liked. Soon, its weights should be available to anybody willing to provide the hardware.

That is enough to change the question.

The question is no longer whether open models will catch the frontier in some abstract future. It is how much of a lead the closed labs need, how long they can hold it, and which customers will still pay for every extra point once switching becomes routine.

Being the best model still matters. Being the only credible option mattered more.
